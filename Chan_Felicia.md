### 
 github is a resource to collaborate and track code. There are many different functions and that is cool. 
* forks
* branches
* markdowns
* pull requests
* repositories are like folders
* cloning

## Forks, branches and pull requests
A fork is a way to copy a repository. It is a way to make changes on other peoples or your own code without affecting the original project. Branches are for when you do not want work to be in your original project yet. This is a good feature as it allows for changes that can later be easily found and changed, like fixing bugs, and experimenting with new ideas. Pull requests are used when working with branches. It is a feature that allows you to tell others what changes were made, ask questions and recieve feedback. This is a helpful way for communication during collaborative projects. 

## Repositories
These are like 'project folders'. This can be collaborative or worked on by yourself. Since repositories are stored in the cloud, cloning repositories allow a local copy of the file onto your computer.
