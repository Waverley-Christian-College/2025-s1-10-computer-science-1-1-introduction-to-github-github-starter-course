**respritories**
- where your project work happens

**branches**
- they allow you to work on separate features or bug fixes without affecting the main project. Once changes are reviewed, they can be merged into the main branch.

**forks**
- A fork is another way to copy a repository, but is usually used when you want to contribute to someone elseâ€™s project. You can experiment with changes withotu affecting the whole thing using forks

**Pull requests**
- when pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add more changes if need be.
  
**Issues**
- issues are a way to track enhancements, tasks, or bugs for your work on GitHub. Issues are a great way to keep track of all the tasks you want to work on for your project and let others know what you plan to work on.


**cloning**
- You can clone a repository to create a local copy on your computer and then use Git to sync the two.
