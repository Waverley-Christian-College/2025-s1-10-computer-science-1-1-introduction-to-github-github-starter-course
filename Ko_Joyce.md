## What I learnt about Github

### Repositories
-  Repositories are where the project work happens. Repositories also contain READMEs. README files are used to to tell other people why your project is useful. GitHub dashboard helps to navigate repositories and see useful information about them. 
### Forks: 
- Forks is another way copy a repository. It is normally used when you want to contribute someone else's project. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project and is very popular when contributing to open source software projects. 
### Branches: 
- Branches are used when you want to isolate work that you do not want to merge into the final project. Branches allows you to develop features, fix bugs, or safety experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. Typically branches might be formed from the default branch of your main. Creating a new branch from the default branch makes a new working copy of the repository to experiment with. 
###  cloning
- You can clone a repository when you want to create a local copy on you computer and then use git to sync the two. Cloning makes it easier to to fix issues, add or remove files, and push larger commits. Cloning a repository also pulls down all the repository data that github has at one point of time. This can be helpful if you experiment with your project and liked the previous one more.
