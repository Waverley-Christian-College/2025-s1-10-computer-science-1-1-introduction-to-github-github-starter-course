# Guess what? I learned Github yippee


## Git and Github
I am very new to Github, so I learned quite a lot. I learned that Git is a tool used to track changes to code that I create, collaborate, and share. It also enables people to work together and put their knowledge into one source. Github is also a software that is used quite frequently across the world to collaborate and maintain the history of it. It is also the place where you start and work on projects that you want to work on.

## The GitHub flow

Repositories: 
It is the main place where work occurs and where others can collaborate.
Cloning: 
Shows all the previous versions of your repositories and stores it in the cloud so you can pick the one you like the most.
Committing and pushing:
These are basically ways of how to add changes made on the local machine onto the remote repository on Github.

## TERMS
Repository:
They contain README's which are files where you can write out and tell collaborators what they can do or help with in terms of the project.
Branches:
These are isolated work which you might just want to trial something which you can add to the final project. This allows to make changes, improvements, and fix bugs.
Forks:
Forking is a way to copy a repository where it is usually used in collaboration projects to give suggestions or improvements without impacting the main project.
Pull requests:
Pull requests are used to tell other collaborators feedback, and it can merge to the main branch when you are ready to share.
Issues:
Issues are a way to rack enhancements, tracks, and bugs for my work on Github.
User profile:
Tells the story that of my work to others by showing my repositries which I am interested in.
Markdown on Github:
Pretty much what i am using right now, which I can edit with simple syntax.
