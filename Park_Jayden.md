## Things I learnt in Github

#### Repositories

- I learnt that Repositary is where the information is gathered, stored analyzed and archived in one organized space.
- I think I want to learn more about Repositary

#### Forks
- Something important when becoming a software developer is fork. 
- I learnt that Fork is mostly used by developers to take the source code for an existing project and helps you understand to create new software based on the original code.

Some things I learnt in Github, is all about using signs like (#) in front of the word or phrase. I also founded out that the depending on the number of hashatgs you write, corresponds to the heading level. Like writing one hastag results in saying 'heading level 1' and writing 6 gives you 'heading level 6'. This made me wonder, why is it not possible to get 'heading level 7' even though you wrote the right amount of hashtag.
