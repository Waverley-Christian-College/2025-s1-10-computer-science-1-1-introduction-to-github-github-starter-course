# **What I learnt about Github**
## Git and GitHub
Git is a distributed **Version Control System** (VCS), which is a tool that tracks changes in code, whether working by yourself, or in a collaboration. By using Git, which is universally accepted as the best VCS, you can track your project with much more clarity, as you can easily collect a record of all versions you've worked on, and you can easily revert back to older versions of a project if needed. Git makes collaborating on projects a lot easier as well. Many people working on the same roject can merge their changes into one source/version.

GitHub is basically a UI for Git, making it easier for beginner developers to start coding and collaborate on projects.

## Understanding the GitHub flow
### Repositories
A repository is a data structure that stores your project's files. It also contains the project's past versions. In GitHub a repository is open-source and public by default. You can work within a repository alone, or with other people via collaboration.

### Cloning
When creating a repository, it is stored in the cloud, but if you want to work on a repository locally (or when you're offline), you can clone your (or other's) repository on to your computer, by using `git clone`. By cloning a repository, it makes it easier to add/remove files, and push larger commits. If you do not like the GitHub editor UI, by cloning your repository, you can use a third-party editor of your choice. Cloning a repository also pulls down all the data that GitHub had at that point in time, as well as all versions of all file and folder of the project.

### Commiting and pushing
Commiting and pushing is how you add or remove changes you made on a local, cloned repo. You can make a commit after you have finished making changes to a project that you want to checkpoint (so you don't lose your work). A commit message can be used to tell others what you have done to the project. Once you have commited or have done multiple commits, you can use `git push` to add the changes to the remote repo.
